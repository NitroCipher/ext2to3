Converting Scratch 2.0 Extensions to Scratch 3.0

## Usage
1. Install this userscript with Tampermonkey
2. Go to ```https://scratch.mit.edu/convert/?url=``` and add ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NitroCipher/NitroBlock/master/MainScript.js``` (or your own extension url)
3. This should convert display the new converted script!
4. You can now download by clicking ```Download ___ as a 3.0 extension file```
5. Host the extension on a github repo such, and enable gh-pages
6. Get the link for the extension (should look something like ```https://nitrocipher.github.io/ext2to3/ext-test.js```)
7. Append that to ```https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url=```, and try out your new extension!

### WARNING: This is highly experimental (and highly incomplete), and I would love help with it

Once you have the script installed, [go here for an example](https://scratch.mit.edu/convert/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NitroCipher/NitroBlock/master/MainScript.js)
